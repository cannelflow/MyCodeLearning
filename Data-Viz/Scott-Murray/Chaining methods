d3.select("body").

    text("New Paragraph !!!");
/*
1.d3 — References the D3 object, so we can access its methods.
.select("body") — Give select() a CSS selector as input, and it will return a reference 
to the first element in the DOM that matches. (Use selectAll() when you need more than one element.) In this case, we just want the body, so a 
reference to body is handed off to the next method in our chain.
2..append("p") — append() creates whatever new DOM element you specify and appends it to the end 
(but just inside) of whatever selection it’s acting on. In our case, we want to create a new p 
within the body. We specified "p" as the input argument, but this method also sees the reference to
body that was passed down the chain from the select() method. Finally, append(), in turn, hands down 
a reference to the new element it just created.
3..text("New paragraph!") — text() takes a string and inserts it between the opening and 
closing tags of the current selection. Since the previous method passed down a reference to our new p, 
this code just inserts the new text between <p> and </p>. (In cases where there is existing content, it will be overwritten.)
4.; — The all-important semicolon indicates the end of this line of code.
